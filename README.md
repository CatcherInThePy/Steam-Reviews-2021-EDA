# Exploratory Data Analysis of 2021 Steam Video Game Reviews

The main goal of this project is to concentrate on two main Vâ€™s of big data: Volume and Value. This is achieved through an exploratory data analysis that centers around examining trends and user behavior within a vast dataset consisting of video game reviews. The ultimate aim is to offer valuable insights to the video game industry, which can be beneficial for various aspects such as design, development, community building, and public relations.

## Introduction
With the massive expansion in the recent years, video gaming industry has become one of the largest markets in the
globe, surpassing traditional entertainment venues like movies and music. This growth presents a significant opportunity
for investors and developers seeking to enter this thriving market. However, as the supply of video games continues
to increase, it becomes crucial to accurately discern trends and preferences across different regions and user groups, enabling the design of games that align with market demands.
In this context, leveraging big data analytics encompassing both volume and value aspects can yield valuable insights
to address our research questions effectively. To fulfill this need, an ideal source of data lies in the form
of video game reviews directly provided by players themselves.

Steam , a digital distribution platform catering to both video game enthusiasts and developers, has been operational since 2003 and boasts approximately 30 million
daily active users. For this project, a sizable dataset of 8.2 GB comprising video game reviews from the Steam platform in 2021 is utilized to capture the voluminous aspect of our big
data analytics endeavor.

To encompass the value aspect, an exploratory data analysis is conducted on this extensive dataset. The analysis
comprises two key components. Firstly, we aim to identify trends and video game preferences for the year 2021. Secondly, we delve into an examination of user behavior when
composing reviews for video games.

The analysis follows a structured approach that involves formulating research questions and subsequently addressing
them through data manipulation techniques. By conducting this analysis, I can summarize my contributions and findings
as follows:

- Identified the most and least popular, loved, and played
titles among all users, top consumers, and top reviewers.
- Conducted a thorough comparison to provide valuable
insights for game designers and developers.
- Observed distinct trends and preferences among different user groups and geographical regions, emphasizing the importance of selecting target markets and
audiences.
- Noted that users tend to review gifts more positively,
suggesting that offering free content can enhance public relations.
- Identified the most helpful and entertaining communities, enabling community managers to study these
titles and cultivate supportive communities for their video games. Overall, users share a common sense of
humor, as the most popular titles have the funniest reviews.

## Dataset
For this project, I used the publicly available Steam Reviews Dataset 2021, which can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021. 
The dataset encompasses a staggering **21,747,371** video game reviews authored by **12,406,560** unique users. These reviews are written
